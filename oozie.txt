There are two basic types of Oozie jobs:

Oozie Workflow : jobs are Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs), specifying a sequence of actions to execute. The Workflow job has to wait
Oozie Coordinator : jobs are recurrent Oozie Workflow jobs that are triggered by time and data availability.

Oozie workflow consists of action nodes and control-flow nodes.

An action node represents a workflow task, e.g., moving files into HDFS, running a MapReduce, Pig or Hive jobs, importing data using Sqoop or running a shell script of a program written in Java.
A control-flow node controls the workflow execution between actions by allowing constructs like conditional logic wherein different branches may be followed depending on the result of earlier action node.

Oozie Bundle provides a way to package multiple coordinator and workflow jobs and to manage the lifecycle of those jobs.


running oozie job
------------------

$ oozie job -oozie http://localhost:11000/oozie -config sqoop-wf/job.properties -run

// after submitting the job you will get job id ( 0000000-160228083656134-oozie-oozi-W )

// below cmd is used to know the status of d job
$ oozie job -oozie http://localhost:11000/oozie -info job: job: 0000001-160228184816372-oozie-oozi-W


// remove the old folder from hdfs 
   $ hadoop fs -rmr examples/apps/sqoop-wf
// copy the folder 
   $ hadoop fs -put /root/sqoop-wf examples/apps/sqoop-wf   

   
   
add environmental variable if not available in 
export HADOOP_HOME = /usr/local/hadoop
export PATH = $PATH:/usr/lib/sqoop/lib

 definition file :  coordinator.xml
 config file : coord-config-default.xml
 
properties file
  coordinator.properties.xml or job.properties
  
  
WF definition file : workflow.xml
