how to use group by 
concepts of sub-query 



Group by :
   When you want to group the records based on some key 
   Ex: Select sum(salary) from table group by <Col_id> 

Difference between where and having 
                  where                                        having 
    1) It can come in update query as well        it will come only with select query
    2) can be used without group by               it can be used only with Group by 
    3) It will filter the result                  it will fetch all records and doing group by and filter the records from group 
       and group if  needed	
    4) Aggregation function cannot be used         Aggragation function can be used 
    e where SUM(salary) > 4000 ; // CANNOT USE     ie Group by City Having salary sum(salary) > 5400;
	  
	  	  
CRUD operation :
  Create , Read , update , delete 

ACID property 
  Atomicity :  
  Consistency :  how does consistency acheived 
  Isolation:  Concurreny control management ensured this property , when two threads are performing updates on database 
  Durability : 
    
Sub Query : 
    Non-Correlated sub Query : inner query not depends on the outer query ie inner query runs independentaly 
	Correlated sub Query : inner query depends on the outer query 

	
Triggers : 
   A trigger is a special kind of stored procedure that automatically executes when an event occurs in the database server
    Trigger can be fired on insert , update and delete commands
   
Difference between TRUNCATE, DELETE and DROP commands
   TRUNCATE  : TRUNCATE TABLE emp;  // all the rows in the tables are deleted , NOTE: trigger will not be fired 
   DELETE    : Delete a particular row in the table 
   DROP      : Drop the table itself  ie table itself removed from the database 

Index : Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval
     // you can correlate with our book index , assume last few pages is the lookup table , using this your retrievel will be faster 
	 CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
