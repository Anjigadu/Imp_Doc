I have data 
  1. 1 (10 times) , 3 (30 times), 5(40 times) , 6 (10 times) ,7 (40 times),8(30 times) 
  
  
  
  1.what if my distribution having 2 modes  
  2. df comes in to the picture when we dont know abt the parent population sd , while explaining chi-square test we are using df since we have parent population
  
  
  1.in chi-square test , you are comparing two entity .. logically it is different . but data may force you to conclude two entities are dependent 
  2.quickly compare t-test ,chi-square test
