There are two basic types of Oozie jobs:

Oozie Workflow : jobs are Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs), specifying a sequence of actions to execute. The Workflow job has to wait
Oozie Coordinator : jobs are recurrent Oozie Workflow jobs that are triggered by time and data availability.


Oozie workflow consists of action nodes and control-flow nodes.

An action node represents a workflow task, e.g., moving files into HDFS, running a MapReduce, Pig or Hive jobs, importing data using Sqoop or running a shell script of a program written in Java.
A control-flow node controls the workflow execution between actions by allowing constructs like conditional logic wherein different branches may be followed depending on the result of earlier action node.



Oozie Bundle provides a way to package multiple coordinator and workflow jobs and to manage the lifecycle of those jobs.
