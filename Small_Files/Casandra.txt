Falls in NoSql scope 

What is the real time use case of using casandra 

Cansandra : OLTP , there are some other tools for OLAP(Analytics ) but we could use it 

what is vertical and horizondal scalability ? 
 Vertical scaling : adding more RAM,CPU, Hard disk etc to a particular machine 
 horizondal scaling : adding more number of machine in the cluster 
 horizondal scaling : adding more number of machine in the cluster 
 
What is Elastic scalability 
  adding or remving node from a cluster ( think of rubber , when you stretch it is stretching , when you leave it, it back to the pos)

Casandra : is not a master and slave paradigm , 
           here are the nodes are identical, all are performing same task 
How casandra managing the cluster ?
    In casandra cluster , all nodes are identical, so it has the Peer to Peer communication, with the help of it , it is managing the cluster 


What is Column Family 

How index works in database 

Casandra can work well with Structured and semi-Structured Data , It can store un Structured (File ,Image , Video) but it is not recommnded 
	
	
HBase vs Cassandra    based on use case (ie where to use what )
  Both are NoSql style and Column family 
  
  
  
Important Keyword :
------------------------

KeySpace :  Analogy to the database in the RDBMS
Column Falimy: Analogy to the table in the RDBMS

System Keyspace:  Cassandra has an internal keyspace called System keyspace to store meta data(Cluster Name, Node's token (Key Range) , Keyspace and schema definition for dynamic loading,migration data and wheather or not node is bootstapred) info. this cant be edited by the programmer 

Migration data : Config changes of the cluster is stored in migration data ex: Changing replication factor from 1 to 2 stored in migration data 
Bootstarp : when you add a new node (called dump node) to the cluster, this has to be bootstarped ie all the cluster config has to configured and data should be copied from peer node. 
Peer node : we can declare some node as peer node in the configuration file 

Hinted handoff :   
Tombstones :  this means soft delete  , check why it is used . it is hard to delete the record , it has to  delete the complete record which is available in different SS table.
So , records are just marked and during compaction it is deleted .  	
Read repair : 
Memtable :
SSTable :
CommitLog: 
 

  
  
  
Cassndra important point to note :
------------------------------------


Java interpretation
----------------------
1. each table (Column family) is a distributed Hashmap
2. Each row is a sorted Hashmap

in sort , table in the form of  Hashmap<rowkey,SortedHashMap<ColumnKey,ColumnValue>>
  
  
Where to use :
  No secondary index ( what is py & sy index)
  wide column range 

  
Can I use casandra if I have a req to group data? yes you can , but performance is too low , hence not recommended  
  

How read and write happens in Cassandra ? very Imp the detail code flow 

There are no update in Cassandra , there are only append data in the table 

Why timestamp associated in all the columns ? Ans : to make write operation fast , cassandra just writes the data rather than updating the record . based the latest timestamp it gets the data and returns the value to the user 



// cassandra setup and how to run 
  -------------------------------------
  
  Software requirements : JDK 1.7 and python 2.7 
  
  add jdk  in the path variable  if needed ( $ java -version  ..  this cmd returns something then java exists )
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.7.0_80   (Note : there should not be any space around '=' , if it is , it will throw an error)
  export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
  
  
  $ easy_install pip
  $ pip install cqlsh
  
  // to run cassandra and start cqlsh
  $ bin/cassandra -f    // -f for keep the process in foreground
  $ bin/cqlsh       // in another putty window 
  $ bin/nodetool status       // to check the status
  
  cqlsh > CREATE KEYSPACE demo WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 };
  cqlsh > use demo;
  cqlsh:demo > CREATE TABLE owner (id int,name text,pet text,PRIMARY KEY (id));   // cant create table without primary key 
  cqlsh:demo >INSERT INTO demo.owner (id, name,pet)  VALUES (1, 'johndoe','fish') USING TTL 86400;

  
  from clinet :
  -----------------
 1. you need to change the .yaml in config folder  
   rpc_address : 0.0.0.0
   broadcast_address : 1.2.3.4   
   
   
   
 Practical problems :
   bin $ ./cassandra -f   // process started and killed 
   bin $ ./cassandra      // process started
