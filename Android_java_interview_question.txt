JAVA:
=============================
oops concepts
string and string builders
abstract & interface
final, finally & finalize
static and final
diff between this and super
handlers and how it works
threads
why multiple inheritance not supported in java
thread sleep and thread wait
collections in java
hashtable and hashmap
iterator and for loop
design patterns
multithread over singleton
looper
executor service

array and hasmap difference
prgm to write power of 2 
prgm to write no of duplicate values
how android gets added to oops concept  
muttable and immutable
synchronized block and method in singleton and y constructor is private
what is multi thread and single thread environment
code using immutable

The Following Android Classes uses Design Patterns
--------------------------------------------------
1) View Holder uses Singleton Design Pattern
2) Intent uses Factory Design Pattern
3) Adapter uses Adapter Design Pattern
4) Broadcast Receiver uses Observer Design Pattern
5) View uses Composite Design Pattern
6) Media FrameWork uses Façade Design Pattern
